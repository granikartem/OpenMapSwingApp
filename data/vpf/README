This directory contains information that is used by the
VPFFeatureLayer and the VPFAutoFeatureGraphicWarehouse.  The
symbol-lookup files are summaries of the MIL-PRF-89045 GeoSym standard
contents, that tie FACC codes, with certain parameter conditions, to
GeoSym symbol numbers.

The dcw versions are pretty complete.  The vmaplv0 version is not at
all, but they contain a sample for inland water that should get you
started.  You'll need a copy of the 89045 doc to figure out the symbol
types you want to display.  The VPFFeatureLayer uses the geosym cgm
files, you'll have to track those down (I'm not sure of the
releaseability).


The properties for a layer that uses these files are here:
vpf_water.class=com.bbn.openmap.layer.vpf.VPFFeatureLayer
vpf_water.prettyName=VMAPLV0 Inland Water
vpf_water.vpfPath=/Volumes/data/vpf/vmaplv0/v0noa/vmaplv0
# VFPAutoFeatureGraphicWarehouse options:
vpf_water.cgmDirectory=data/geosym/cgm/
vpf_water.faccLookupFile=data/vpf/vmaplv0-symbol-lookup.csv
# The priority file is the file to adjust to customize display...
vpf_water.priorityFile=data/vpf/vmaplv0-priority-iw.csv
vpf_water.featureInfoHandler=com.bbn.openmap.layer.vpf.TTFeatureInfoHandler

The order of how different features are laid out are specified in the
priority file, and feature rendering is determined by the cgm files.

Using this layer can be slower than the standard VPFLayer, especially
with a lot of FACC codes being rendered.  I recommend that you
configure the layer, and then use it to make map image tiles with the
com.bbn.openmap.dataAccess.mapTile.MapTileMaker.  You can then use the
tiles in the map using the com.bbn.openmap.layer.image.MapTileLayer.
